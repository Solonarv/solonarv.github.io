## [Exclusions](exclusions/index.html)

A setting with many different magic systems, some of which are excluded
(restricted to a particular region and/or person). Has lots of homebrew
rules intended to make the game crunchier.

## [Brightest Stars, Darkest Nights](brightest-stars-darkest-nights.html)

An endless steppe, traveled by nomads or settled in great cities,
where living constellations advise an immortal Empress and mark champions
to embody their ideals.

From the Underworld, six demon princes also empower mortals to further their dark
agendas and funnel more mortal slaves back to their masters.
