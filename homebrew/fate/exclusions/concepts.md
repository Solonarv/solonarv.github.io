## Skills

Skills are numerical attributes that represent your character's
proficiency and level of training in a particular field or at a
particular set of tasks.

### Half-cost Discount

Some groups of related skills have a half-cost discount. This means
that, when purchasing a level of a skill in the group, if the old level
is less than the highest skill level in the group, you pay only half the XP.
Fractional XP is accounted for; you do not have to round up or down.
