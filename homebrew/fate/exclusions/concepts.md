## Aspects



## Skills

Skills are numerical attributes that represent your character's
proficiency and level of training in a particular field or at a
particular set of tasks.

### Leveling skills

Your character starts with a 0 in each skill. To increase your level in a
skill by one, you must pay XP equal to the skill's new level. For example,
to increase a skill to level 10 from scratch, you have to pay a total of
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = **55 XP**. Some skills are "double-cost"
or "half-cost", meaning that you pay double or half that amount.

The total cost to buy a skill all the way up to level *N* is *N \* (N+1) / 2*.

### The skill pyramid

In order for a skill list to be valid, the number of your skills with aspect bonus N cannot
exceed the number of your skills with aspect bonus N-1. If you are spending large amounts
of XP at once, you can jump directly to another valid state. You are assumed to have
an arbitrary number of skills at level 0.

This rule, along with the increasing cost to level the same skill, is meant to encourage
branching out and having multiple skills relevant to your character, leading to more
varied gameplay.

### Half-cost Discount

Some groups of related skills have a half-cost discount. This means
that, when purchasing a level of a skill in the group, if the old level
is less than the highest skill level in the group, you pay only half the XP.
Fractional XP is accounted for; you do not have to round up or down.
