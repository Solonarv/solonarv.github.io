## Overview

*Exclusions* is a setting (or rather a setting template) filled with a great variety
of magic systems. Crunch is provided using a variant of the FATE rules.

The rules are detailed in [Concepts](concepts.html).

### Differences from FATE

Much of these are cribbed from the [Fated to Die](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdE1lGoRnzj4HIuzlYdDq18FTYZ5s-Qxa1Mt0NR_cQM/edit#heading=h.u2c080bpff7f)
system, which is used by the [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/)
forum quest.

 - XP gain: Players gain experience and use it to directly purchase skill levels and stunts.
 - Skill scale: Skill numbers are larger, roughly 10x compared to standard FATE.
 - Aspect Bonus: To work with the increased skill scale, invoking an Aspect gains you a variable bonus based on your skill.
 - Fudge Dice: To work with the increased skill scale, the values on Fudge dice are tripled to [-3, 0, +3].

to various magical effects while in the library.
