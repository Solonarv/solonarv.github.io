## Overview

*Exclusions* is a setting (or rather a setting template) filled with a great variety
of magic systems. Crunch is provided using a variant of the FATE rules.

The rules are detailed in [Concepts](concepts.html).

### Differences from FATE

Much of these are cribbed from the [Fated to Die](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdE1lGoRnzj4HIuzlYdDq18FTYZ5s-Qxa1Mt0NR_cQM/edit#heading=h.u2c080bpff7f)
system, which is used by the [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/)
forum quest.

 - XP gain: Players gain experience and use it to directly purchase skill levels and stunts.
 - Skill scale: Skill numbers are larger, roughly 10x compared to standard FATE.
 - Aspect Bonus: To work with the increased skill scale, invoking an Aspect gains you a variable bonus based on your skill.
 - Fudge Dice: To work with the increased skill scale, the values on Fudge dice are tripled to [-3, 0, +3].

## List of magics

### [Water magic](water-magic.html)

Water mages have access to a pocket dimension which can store only pure water. They can form portals
near the surface of their skin, through which they can eject or absorb water.

### [Library magic](library-magic.html)

Library mages form bonds to libraries and their genius loci, allowing them access
to various magical effects while in the library.

### [Blood magic](blood-magic.html)

Blood mages attune to the rhythm of their heartbeat and telekinetically control their blood.
They are formidable foes in combat and very hard to bring down.

### [Illusion magic](illusion-magic.html)

Illusion mages create illusions that engulf all senses and are very hard to break out of.

### [Ink magic](ink-magic.html)

Ink mages research and draw patterns in magical ink that can create a great variety of effects.

### [Blade magic](blade-magic.html)

Blade-savants use their willpower to mystically amplify any cutting edge, allowing them to Cut
nearly anything - not only physical objects (mundane or magical), but also abstract things such
as time, space, lies, or justice. Nothing stands in the way of a master blade-savant.

### [Ice magic](ice-magic.html)

Ice mages exploit an Ice Entity, an ancient imprisoned evil that desires a frozen death
for the entire universe. Wisps of an Ice Entity's power and consciousness leak out of its
prison. Ice mages draw on these wisps. By sacrificing their own body heat, they draw an
Ice Entity's diffuse attention to a nearby location, sapping an equal amount of heat from there.
