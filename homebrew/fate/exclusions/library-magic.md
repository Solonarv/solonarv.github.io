## Libraries

Library mages form bonds with (the *genius loci* of) libraries. A genius loci
is formed via an extended ritual performed to designate a volume of space and
the works (books, images, music, and so on) within as a library. The genius loci's
personality is based on the works contained in the library as well as its creator(s),
and it retains a special bond with its creator.

The strength of a genius loci varies depending on the size, variety, rarity, and
significance of the library's collection, as well as the number and strength
of its bonds to library mages.

### Warped Space

Libraries with a powerful enough genius loci may have various space-warping effects
appear within and around them. Common effects are "bigger on the inside", hidden
entrances, and portal doorways.

## Skills

### Half-cost discount

Purchasing a level in a Library Magic skill costs 50% less XP if the new level is
less than your highest Library Magic skill level.

### Library Bond

Single-cost skill. You have a different Library Bond skill for each library you
have bonded with. To increase the level of a Library Bond skill, a prolonged
visit to that library is necessary.

Each library provides bonded mages a different set of abilities, which become
more versatile and powerful as the bond strengthens - i.e. the corresponding Library
Bond skill increases in level.

The maximum level of a Library Bond skill is based on the strength of that
library's genius loci.

## Rituals

Library mages manage their bonds to libraries through a handful of lengthy
magical processes confusingly called rituals (no relation to [ritual magic](ritual-magic.html)).

### Entering the Library

Duration: 10 minutes to several hours
Requirements: Must be performed inside the library. Genius loci must approve.

You bond with a library and its genius loci, allowing you to use its magic.
If you are already bonded, you strengthen your bond, allowing you greater
access to the library's magic.
Spend XP to increase the level of your Library Bond skill for this library.
This ritual might involve anything from simply communing with the genius loci,
through helping out with library tasks, all the way to gifting/loaning it rare
books or other works. The duration and difficulty of the ritual scale with
the previous level of Library Bond as well as the amount of levels added.

### Severing the Bond

Duration: 5 minutes
Requirements: Must be performed inside the library.

You sever your bond with a library and its genius loci.
You lose all levels of your Library Bond skill for this library.
You regain some of the XP spent on those skill levels. If you part
on good or neutral terms with the genius loci, you regain 3/4 of the
XP spent. If you part on bad or hostile terms, you regain only half.

### Expanding the Collection

Duration: variable
Requirements: Must be performed inside the library.

You add one or more works (books, art, music, ...) to the library's
collection. Storing the works in their proper place is part of the ritual,
as is explaining their content and the purpose of the addition to the
genius loci.

### Altering the Premises

Duration: variable
Requirements: Must be performed inside or just outside the library. Building materials may be needed.

You expand, shrink, or otherwise remodel the building the library sits in.
This ritual includes changes both to the outer boundaries and the interior,
as well as altering the library's space-warping effect if the genius loci
is powerful enough for such an effect to be present.
