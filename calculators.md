Various HTML+JS calculators I've created.

 - [Spectrify](spectrify.html) - transform text into an approximation of Spectre's voice
 - [Labyrinth Facetank Calculator](lab-calc.html) - determines whether your build can tank damage from traps in PoE's Labyrinth. Severely outdated, left here for archival purposes.
 - [Multiclass Spell Slot Calculator](5e-slot-calculator.html) - calculates your spell slots for a multiclassed character in D&D 5e.
