Miscellaneous self-contained sub-sites, listed here so that they're actually findable.

### Tabletop RPGs

 - [Multiclass Spell Slot Calculator](5e-slot-calculator.html) - calculates your spell slots for a multiclassed character in D&D 5e.

### Miscellaneous
 - [Random Dots](random-dots.html) - Generates 200 random dots on a 320Ã—240 canvas. There is no deeper purpose.
 - [Spectrify](spectrify.html) - Legends say that the voice lines for *Dota 2*'s Spectre were created by overlaying
   human speech with reversed and distorted copies of itself. This page does the same to text.
 - [Labyrinth Calculator](lab-calc.html) - _Path of Exile_'s Labyrinth area contains many traps that deal heavy damage.
   This calculator tells you whether your character is sturdy enough to survive them... or rather, it did, long ago.
   The calculator has not been updated in many years, but the game has.
